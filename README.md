## Lessons Learned
	Methods calling methods to create particular functions, like a player or a deck of cards.
	How different classes in OOP compartmentalize and protect functions, and make reading/understanding code easier.
	Good lessons in envisioning how to code for complexity and nuance, e.g. my dealer only hits once, then declares winner/loser/push.
	My review of lessons at night feels like it's helping.
